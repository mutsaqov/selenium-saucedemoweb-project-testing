### 🚀 How to Run Tests
Execute all test scenarios from your VS Code terminal while in the root project directory:

```bash
python tests/test_login_page.py


### 📝 Test Reporting
The execution results are automatically saved in HTML format within the Report_Test folder generated by html-testRunner.
1. Navigate to the Report_Test/ folder.
2. Double-click the generated .html file to view the Pass/Fail report in your browser.

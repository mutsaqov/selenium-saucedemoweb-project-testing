# 🤖 Selenium Automation Test - SauceDemo E-Commerce
*(Automation Testing Portfolio Project)*

This project implements an exploration of Automation Testing using **Selenium** and **Python**, focusing on the **Page Object Model (POM)** architecture. The goal is to ensure the core functionalities of the SauceDemo web demo run smoothly and stably.

### 🗺️ Project Roadmap & Features to be Implemented
The following features are planned for automation coverage in this project:
1. Login (Positive and Negative cases) ✅ **[COMPLETED]** ✅
2. Inventory list page ✅ **[COMPLETED]** ✅
3. Product details ⏳ **[On The Way]** ⏳
4. Checkout item
5. Cart
6. Logout
7. (Additional) Filtering and Sorting Items

### 🛠️ Tech Stack & Dependencies

* **Language:** Python 3.x
* **Testing Framework:** `unittest`
* **Automation Library:** Selenium (Python)
* **Reporting Tool:** `html-testRunner`
* **Driver Management:** `webdriver-manager`

### ⚙️ Prerequisites (Local Setup)

Ensure you have Python 3.x installed. Then, install all necessary dependencies using the following command:

```bash
pip install selenium html-testrunner webdriver-manager
```

### 📂 Project Structure (Page Object Model)
### LOGIN PAGE
The project utilizes the POM architecture to separate logic and improve maintainability:


| Folder/File | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| `pages/` | Contains all Page Object Classes (Locators and Actions). Example: `login_page.py` . |
| `tests/` | Contains the Test Cases (Scenarios and Assertions). Example: `test_login_page.py` . |
| `README.md` | This project documentation file. |


### 🚀 How to Run Tests
Execute all test scenarios from your VS Code terminal while in the root project directory:

```bash
python tests/test_login_page.py
```

## 📦 Feature: Inventory & Product Management

This module handles the main product listing page, covering comprehensive test scenarios from UI validation to dynamic "Add to Cart" logic.

### 📋 Positive Test Scenarios Covered (`tests/test_inventory.py`)

| Test Case ID | Scenario | Description & Validation |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **TC-01** | Inventory Display | Ensures the page loads products correctly (Assert item count > 0). |
| **TC-02** | Add Item by Name | Adds specific items (via Dynamic XPath) using a **List Loop** to handle multiple items efficiently. |
| **TC-03** | Add Item by Index | Adds the top 3 items from the list using an **Index Loop** strategy. |
| **TC-04** | Product Sorting | Validates all 4 sorting options (A-Z, Z-A, Low-High, High-Low) using **Dictionary Mapping**. |
| **TC-05** | Cart Navigation | Verifies that clicking the cart icon correctly redirects to `cart.html`. |
| **TC-06** | Sidebar Menu | Verifies that the Burger Menu is clickable and opens the sidebar. |

### 🧠 Key Technical Implementations

This feature implements several **Advanced Selenium** techniques:

1.  **Dynamic XPath Locator:**
    A strategy to locate "Add to Cart" buttons based on the product name without hardcoding IDs.
    ```python
    f"//div[text()='{item_name}']/ancestor::div[@class='inventory_item']//button"
    ```

2.  **Data-Driven Loops:**
    Utilizing Python `Lists` and `Dictionaries` to iterate through test data, reducing code duplication and increasing coverage.

3.  **Dropdown Handling:**
    Using Selenium's `Select` class to interact with and validate the product sorting dropdown menu.

### 📝 Test Reporting
The execution results are automatically saved in HTML format within the Report_Test folder generated by html-testRunner.
1. Navigate to the Report_Test/ folder.
2. Double-click the generated .html file to view the Pass/Fail report in your browser.
